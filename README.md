# Jellyfin-Notify
A work in progress Jellyfin plugin. The ultimate goal is for this to be easily extensible to support a wide range of notification platforms and purposes.

Currently in the proof of concept phase with a lot of refactoring effort needed once I complete some initial testing.

If you would like to try this out you will currently need to build the plugin from source, create a folder in the plugin directory in your Jellyfin configuration folder, and then place the compiled dll inside the newly created folder.
