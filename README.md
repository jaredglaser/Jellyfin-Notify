# Jellyfin-Notify
A work in progress Jellyfin plugin. The ultimate goal is for this to be easily extensible to support a wide range of notification platforms and purposes.

Currently in the proof of concept phase with a lot of refactoring effort needed once I complete some initial testing.

If you would like to try this out:

Add the plugin manifest.json to the plugin catalog: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaredglaser/Jellyfin-Notify/refs/heads/main/manifest.json`

Find the plugin in the plugin catalog under `Notifications`, install it, and restart jellyfin.
